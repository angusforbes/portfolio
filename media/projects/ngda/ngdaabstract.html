<p>We present a prototype visual browser for georeferenced digital
libraries that allows a library to be navigated, and library content
to be discovered, without explicitly formulating queries.  The browser
also provides a seamless transition from a synoptic view of library
content to examination of individual library items.</p>

<p>A georeferenced digital library organizes information of all
stripes, from raw data to textual documents, into collections of
discrete items, each of which has a geographic region of relevance or
<em>footprint</em>.  Among the geosciences there are copious amounts
of data that are georeferenced, and it has been estimated that over
70% of all textual documents contain relevant georeferences [<a
href="#ref-1">1</a>].  The principal goal of a georefenced digital
library is to take advantage of this metadata, and to take advantage
of the near-universal reference frames provided by cartographic
coordinate systems and geographic placenames, in order to provide
spatial search and navigation services and to reveal spatial context
and relationships.</p>

<p>The dominant paradigm in information retrieval systems is the
query-result cycle: the user first formulates a query; submits the
query and waits for results to appear (usually in the form of a linear
list); examines the results (often limited to examining one at a
time); and perhaps refines the query, thus repeating the cycle.  The
retrieval mechanisms offered by georeferenced digital libraries
(including the <a href="http://www.alexandria.ucsb.edu/">Alexandria
Digital Library</a> (ADL), <a
href="http://www.geodata.gov/">Geospatial One-Stop</a>, and the <a
href="http://www.geographynetwork.com/">Geography Network</a>) as well
as geographically-enhanced Web search systems (including <a
href="http://local.google.com/">Google Local</a>, <a
href="http://local.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Local</a>, and <a
href="http://www.msn.com">MSN</a>) all follow this model.  These
systems typically provide contextual base maps to support the query
formulation phase, but support for visualizing query results is
limited, if present at all.  Also largely missing is the ability to
see spatial relationships among query results and library content as a
whole.  ADL provides some synoptic graphics [<a href="#ref-2">2</a>],
but these are static and not integrated with the search system.</p>

<p>To address these limitations, we have developed a visual browser
for georeferenced digital libraries that eliminates the query/result
cycle.  Instead, the browser displays reduced-resolution versions
(i.e., thumbnails and iconic representations) of all items in the
digital library over a base map.  Map pan and zoom controls provide
the means of navigating the library.  A screen capture of the browser
is shown in the figure below.</p>

<p>Of course, displaying <i>all</i> items immediately begs the
question of <i>how</i> to display the items in a visually coherent
fashion, especially when large numbers of items overlap and even
coincide in geographic space.  After analyzing and categorizing the
types of overlaps encountered in digital library collections [<a
href="#ref-3">3</a>], we developed a suite of de-cluttering
mechanisms:</p>

<ul>

<li>A custom clustering system that groups items having sizes that are
too large or too small or that are too dense to be compatible with the
current zoom level.  Clusters of items are represented by
variable-sized icons to represent the number of library items within a
region. The clusters are defined both by the geospatial range of a
collection and the viewing dimensions of the browser.</li>

<li>Two interface controls that dynamically control the opacity and
size of item footprints.</li>

<li>A novel control widget that combines selection of zoom level with
a histogram depicting the numbers of items visible at each zoom level.
This device allows the user to determine at which zoom levels items
are visible, which is of particular value for items that are too small
and/or dense for the current view, as well as for items that are too
large for the current view (and hence effectively invisible due to the
lack of visible footprint boundaries).</li>

</ul>

<p>Our prototype browser is implemented using the <a
href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/">Google Maps API</a>, and is
built on top of the <a
href="http://www.alexandria.ucsb.edu/middleware/">ADL middleware
server</a> [<a href="#ref-4">4</a>].  To support the rapid response
times needed for visual browsing, an automated preprocessing step,
built on top of core ADL library services, computes and caches certain
display-related information such as clusters and zoom level
histograms.  A demo version of the browser operating over selected
UCSB collections is available at <a
href="http://clients.alexandria.ucsb.edu/ngda/">http://clients.alexandria.ucsb.edu/ngda/</a>.</p>

<p>Future development includes integration with other (non-geographic)
query criteria; refinement of the aforementioned clutter reducing
mechanisms; reimplementation using the <a
href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">Google Web Toolkit</a>; and
integration on top of the <a href="http://www.ngda.org/">National
Geospatial Digital Archive</a> (NGDA), the funding project for this
work.</p>
