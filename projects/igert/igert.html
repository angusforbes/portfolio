Spheres of Influence is an ongoing interactive information visualization
and digital art project at the University of California, Santa Barbara, 
now entering its third year. The principal exhibit space is approximately 
15ft long, 7ft deep and 10ft high. It includes a wall-mounted display of 
four horizontally tiled large plasma screens, and an overhead motion-tracking 
camera system. Users navigate through the visual and textual material displayed 
on the screens by means of their own movements in front of them. 
The application now presents the location of the twelve most active 
current stories on a set of maps, and allows users to select each in turn 
by “stepping into the story,” to view the global extent and volume of 
coverage on it, as well as representative headlines, photographs and its most 
frequently occurring words.
