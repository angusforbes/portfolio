Data Flow is a large information visualization
art work installed over nine screens on the top three floors
of the Corporate Executive Board headquarters in
Arlington, VA.

The project consists of three visualizations each of which span three screens.
Each visualization makes use of real-time customer activity data.
<p>
The first visualization shows the worldwide traffic flows of customer
interaction with the corporate website and how these change over the course of the day.
The second visualization tracks the most common phrases used to search the
corporate website and shows which phrases are correlated with particular business
sectors.
The third visualization outlines the recent activity of particular
business sectors and the types of content that are most popular
within those sectors.
