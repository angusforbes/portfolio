Ecotone is a nutrient dynamics simulation
which aims to explore how rational agents within a dynamic
system evolve to occupy a particular niche within that
system.
An ecotone is a transition area between two different ecological
communities that exhibits competition between organisms
common to both. The etymology of <i>-tone</i> is the
Greek <i>tonos</i>, meaning tension. That is, it is an area where
organisms are in the process of vying for resources and potentially
of adapting to new niches. Our simulation is
concerned with the tension of unstable and initially
random populations adapting or failing to adapt in competition
with each other.

  <!--
Ecotone is a minimal model of an ecological
system which nonetheless contain enough components
to mimic complex multi-layered behavior. The ecological
landscape consists of a grid of discrete cells. Each cell in the
grid contains some amount of ”nutrients”. The nutrients are
spread throughout the grid both through abiotic and biotic
processes. For instance, a wind system will cause a certain
portion of certain elements to be transferred into adjacent
cells. More complex behavior occurs as the plants, the primary
producers, photosynthesize sunlight and so deposit nutrients
into the ecosystem. Secondary producers, herbivores,
search out the richest areas of plant life. Tertiary producers,
carnivores, hunt herbivores.

Users can interact with Ecotone to manipulate the enviroment by
tuning various parameters
such as the speed and direction of the sun and wind, the nutrient composition of the soil,
and the density and growth rate of plant life.
Additionally, users can control a host of variables that describe the
knowledge bases of the organisms, which effect the ability of carnivores to hunt and herbivores to
flee.

In the above screen captures, we see an unstable ecological system in which all living
creatures will be eaten or die of starvation. In the first capture, sunlight
causes plant life to flourish. Different colored plants indiciate the set of nutrients
that plants consume to survive. In the second cpature, herbivores (green squares) begin to proliferate
in response to the plentiful resources. This in turn causes a population explosion of
carnviores (red squares), as seen in the third capture. In the last capture, carnivores have
completely decimated the environment and will begin to die out due to a lack of resources.

In the below screen captures we see a visualization of the model of the wind system
in which certain nutrients are strewn across the landscape according the the topology of
the landscape and the fluctuations of the wind. The density of the nutrient is represented
by the opacity of the cell.
