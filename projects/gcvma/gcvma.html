The <a class="bandnamee">Global Collaborative Visual Mapping Archive</a> (GCVMA) is a
site specific installation that invites users to upload cell phone
images onto a giant projected canvas. These photos can be tagged by
other users in the space. The system automatically finds connections
between the photos by analyzing the phone numbers and
the tags. This project was developed in collaboration with George Legrady.
