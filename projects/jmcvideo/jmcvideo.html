The jmcvideo library is a wrapper for the Java Media Components package
(bundled with JavaFX) which supports the playback and manipulation
of various media formats
across different platforms. It is intended as a replacement for the
Processing video library.

The library includes two renderers,
one which extends the PImage class
and operates exactly like the Processing Movie library,
and another which stores video data in an
openGL texture and contains some specialized drawing methods.
