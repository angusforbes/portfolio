<p>
  I am PhD student in Media Arts and Technology
  (Visual and Spatial Arts emphasis) at UC Santa Barbara.
  Concurrently, I am pursuing a MS in Computer Science.
  In 2006 I received an NSF IGERT fellowship
  in interactive digital multimedia.
  <p>
  My research interests include information visualization,
  augmented intelligence, computer graphics, computational linguistics,
  and education.
  <p>
  As an artist,
  I am interested in exploring and modelling dynamic,
  organic multi-dimensional spaces in various mediums.
  I am also the drummer in various musical projects,
  including Chamisa Mesa, Heat Death,
  and more recently The Hero and The Victor and Thunderdrop.
  <p>
  My work experience includes programming, design, and teaching.
  From 1999 to 2001 I was a director of software development
  for Micromuse, Inc., a company that develops network management software.
  In 2002, I founded Synaesthetic Software to develop
  music education software. While at UCSB I have been employed as
  a programmer and interface designer for the 
  National Geospatial Digital Archive. In the last year I have
  worked closely with the artist George Legrady to create a series of
  multimedia installations. I lecture in both the Computer Science department
  and in the Media Arts & Techonology program at UCSB.
