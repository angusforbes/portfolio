        Data Flow is a large information visualization
        art work installed over nine screens on the top three floors
        of the Corporate Executive Board headquarters in
        Arlington, VA.

        The project consists of three visualizations each of which span three screens.
        Each visualization makes use of real-time customer activity data.

          The first visualization shows the worldwide traffic flows of customer
          interaction with the corporate website and how these change over the course of the day.
          The second visualization tracks the most common phrases used to search the
          corporate website and shows which phrases are correlated with particular business
          sectors.
          The third visualization outlines the recent activity of particular
          business sectors and the types of content that are most popular
          within those sectors.
